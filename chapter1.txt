Once upon a time, there lived a rabbit with his parents in a burrow. He never went outside his burrow. His parents didn't allow him to go out, because he was young and outside is dangerous.

But he always wanted to go out and explore the world. But he knew his parents will never approve.

He thought the world outside is beautiful.
